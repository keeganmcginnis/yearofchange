  <h3>When i arrived in Berkeley for the first time on Decemeber 9th, it was a mildly cold day, but nothing compared to Ohio's cold. *Shutters at the thought of Ohio's temperature at that current moment* I got off at the Ashby BART station, and started my journey of making it in this city by going up and down Shattuck Ave. and filling out applications.</h3>

<h3>As i was leaving the Burgermeister on Shattuck, (Which i later got a job at actually.), there was a HUGE crowd of people that came down the street. Me being fresh out of Ohio, i had absolutely NO idea what was going on whatsoever. I was a tad scared, but also intrigued. I was then dragged by the crowd a little ways down Shattuck, then down to Martin Luther King Jr. Way before i was able to part the Berkeley-people-sea, like some sort of modern Moses. Why i took pictures while mildly panicing, i'll never remember, but i'm glad i did.</h3>
